# Image-Processing
image processing project
Welcome 👋, We are thrilled to share our recent project in the world of image processing, where I've been working on a project loaded with amazing features. Let's dive into some of the highlights:
1. Color Transformations:
 - Rgb2gray
 - Rgb2binary 🌐
 - Gray2binary ⚫⚪
2. Point Processing Magic:
 - Brightness Adjustment ☀
 - Negative Transformation 🌑
 - Contrast Enhancement 📊
 - Gamma Correction 🌌
3. Histogram Wonders:
 - Understanding image distributions and variations 📈
4. Convolution Playground:
 - Blurring with Mean Filter 🔄
 - Blurring with Weighted Filter ⚖
5. Edge Detection Excitement:
 - Point Detection 🔍
 - Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal Left, and Diagonal Right Detection 📏
6. Sharpening Skills:
 - Point, Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal Left, and Diagonal Right Sharpening ✨
7. Frequency Domain Fascination:
 - Fourier Transform 🔄
 - Inverse Fourier Transform 🔍
 - Ideal, Gaussian, and Butterworth Filters - Low and High Pass 🌐
8. Dealing with Noise:
 - Salt & Pepper Noise 🧂
 - Uniform Noise 📊
 - Gaussian Noise 📉
9. Order Filters Excellence:
 - Min, Max, Median, and Midpoint Filters 🔄
10. Erosion:
 - Ever wondered about the magic behind morphological transformations? 🤔 Let me introduce you to erosion! 🌊 This function plays a crucial role in removing pixel values on object boundaries, bringing out the essence of structural elements. From refining edges to defining intricate details, erosion has become a secret weapon in my image processing toolkit. 🛠️✨
11. Custom Blur Exploration:
Here's where it gets interactive! 🎨 Ever wished to decide your blur range dynamically? Now you can, thanks to the custom blurring feature. With a double click, you've empowered image with a filter that adapts to the range I decide using my mouse. 🖱️

We implement all these features using MATLAB and deploy these functions with 2 GUIs: -
1-    MATLAB GUI.💻
2-    Flutter UI integrated with Flask API. 📱
Some steps of how we are working with flutter: -
Create a Flask Backend:
Use a library like matlab.engine in Python to call MATLAB functions from Python.
Set Up Communication:
Implement an API in Flask that receives requests from the Flutter app and forwards them to MATLAB.
The MATLAB function results can be sent back to the Flask server.
